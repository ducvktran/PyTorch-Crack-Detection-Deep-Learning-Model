# PyTorch-Crack-Detection-Deep-Learning-Model
This repository contains the notebook for a crack detection PyTorch model that was trained using the pretrained model resnet18. This model classifies whether an image has cracks or not. This project was done as part of the IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate.
